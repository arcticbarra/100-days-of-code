**Today's Progress**: Learnt about Git and Github

### Day 1: January 3, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I started tinkering with Pandas form my main project

**Thoughts** Couldn't get the table info from the site using `read_html`, tried with `read_csv` after copying all the text in the site to Excel but this will imply more manual work than it needs to be done, there must be a way to do it with a programming approach.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Made a twitter API using tweepy.

**Thoughts** Started analyzing tweet data using tweepy and pandas, currently focusing on gathering information about riots in Mexico due to an increment in gas prices.

### Day 3: January 5, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Identicon creator using Elixir

**Thoughts** Functional programming is very different to what I'm used to, Elixir's pattern matching is amazing but will take me some time to fully use its potential.

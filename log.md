**Today's Progress**: Learnt about Git and Github

**Thoughts:** I struggled with merging two branches and seeing graphically the commit line between branches. Overall feeling confident on the topic.

### Day 1: January 3, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I started tinkering with Pandas form my main project

**Thoughts** Couldn't get the table info from the site using `read_html`, tried with `read_csv` after copying all the text in the site to Excel but this will imply more manual work than it needs to be done, there must be a way to do it with a programming approach.
